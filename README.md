# reactimageswitcher

In this example, IMAGES is an array of image URLs that we want to display. The ImageSwitcher component uses the useState hook to keep track of the current image index, which starts at 0. It renders a button with an onClick handler that updates the state to show the next image in the list when clicked. The Image component is used to render each image, taking a src prop as input.
